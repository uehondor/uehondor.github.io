<p><a href="http://www.zapier.com">Zapier</a>, is a fantastic "swiss army knife-like" kind of tool for the web.</p>

<p>I've just setup my first Zap that creates a new tweet every time I publish a blog post. All this without a single line of code. Now, That's cool!</p>

<p>It seems to be an efficient way to interact with other APIs/web services, especially if you're not into programming.</p>
