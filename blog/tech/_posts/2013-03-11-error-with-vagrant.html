<p>Earlier today I got this error</p>

{% highlight bash %}
Your VM has become "inaccessible."
Unfortunately, this is a critical error with VirtualBox that Vagrant can not cleanly recover from.
Please open VirtualBox and clear out your inaccessible virtual machines or find a way to fix them.
{% endhighlight %}

<p>I think this happened because I deleted the directory where virtual box store info. about the VM.
Since virtual box could not access these VM metadata, vagrant could not also.</p>

<p>Anyway, I resolved the issue by deleting the .vagrant file created by vagrant and did a</p>
{% highlight bash %}vagrant up{% endhighlight %}

<p>If you have multiple vagrant VMs running on the same machine,  you run he following scripts.</p>
{% highlight bash %}find path/to/vagrant/vm -n ".vagrant" | xargs rm{% endhighlight %}
