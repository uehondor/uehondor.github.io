<p>Hi, my name is above (not literally) and I live in a lovely spa town called <a href="http://www.visitcheltenham.com/">Cheltenham</a> with my lovely wife and kids.
I love all things tech, particularly IoT and cloud computing.</p>

<p>I love travelling - in the last year alone, I have travelled the equivalent of the circumference of the earth three times :D</p>
<p>Reading - well I try to read a book a month.</p>

<p>At home, I spend my time developing software for fun - sometimes to automate manual tasks.</p>
